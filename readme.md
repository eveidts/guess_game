A simple console-based Guess the Number game created in C++. The player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and the player continues until they guess correctly.

Features:
Random number generation within a range (e.g., 1-100).
User receives hints (too high, too low) after each guess.
Counter for the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
Option to play multiple rounds.
How to Play:
The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 (or any other range you set).
The player enters guesses, and the game will tell them if their guess is too high or too low.
The game ends when the player guesses the correct number, and the program shows the number of attempts.
The player is given the option to play again.
